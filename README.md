This project was undertaken as part of the disertation in part fulfilment of the MSc in Mathematical Modelling, taught at UCL (University College London).

The project models forest fire spread using Cellular Automata, taking into account: Wind, Topography, Fire Breaks and Fire Brands.

The code requires a number of data sources, and the locations of the data sourses need to be linked at `Control -> Parameters`.
These sourses can be found at the following locations:

Weather Data: [Climate Data Store](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-single-levels?tab=form)

Surface Water Data: [European Commision Data Store](https://global-surface-water.appspot.com/download)  

Road Data: [Open Street Map, downloaded via Geofabrik](https://www.geofabrik.de/data/download.html)

Elevation Data: [GMTED2010 Database](https://topotools.cr.usgs.gov/gmted_viewer/viewer.htm)

Historic Fire Data: [NASA Earth Data](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/earth-observation-data/near-real-time/firms/active-fire-data)
